# **Investigation Reports**

## 4/6/2026 **PEAK**  
**Scenario:** Unusual activity originating from the private network 10.x.x.x in the logs on the application development server. 
**What I did:**  
- Analyzed server logs(syslog, auth.log, auditd logs, apache logs) to identify malicious requests  
- Traced attacker’s IP, user-agent(Hydra), and exploitation path
- Identified SSh Brute Force.
- Identified unauthorized download and execution payloads.
- Identified exploitation of Sudo(CVE-2021-3156)
- Identified file exfiltration to ngrok.io.
- Identified Data Destruction.
- Mapped attacker behavior to MITRE (T1110,T1105,T1204,T1083,T1041,T1485)  
**Findings:**  
- Server compromised via vulnerable upload endpoint  
- Attacker deployed a PHP web shell and modified site content  
**Tools:** Elatic
**Lessons Learned:**  
- Enforce MFA for SSH.
- Restrict SSH to VPN or jump host.
- Patch sudo to latest version.
- Deploy EDR monitoring on Linux hosts

## 1. **Defaced (Enterprise)**  
**Scenario:** Corporate web server defacement incident.  
**What I did:**  
- Analyzed web server logs to identify malicious HTTP requests  
- Traced attacker’s IP, user-agent, and exploitation path  
- Identified unauthorized file uploads and web shell activity  
- Mapped attacker behavior to MITRE (T1190, T1105, T1505)  
**Findings:**  
- Server compromised via vulnerable upload endpoint  
- Attacker deployed a PHP web shell and modified site content  
**Tools:** Splunk, Wireshark, VirusTotal  
**Lessons Learned:**  
- Importance of WAF rules, file upload validation, and server hardening

## 2. **IR_Ozarks**  
**Scenario:** Suspicious PowerShell execution on a workstation.  
**What I did:**  
- Investigated Sysmon logs for encoded PowerShell commands  
- Decoded Base64 payloads to reveal malicious downloader  
- Identified C2 communication attempts  
- Built detection logic for similar PowerShell misuse  
**Findings:**  
- User executed a malicious script leading to persistence attempts  
**Tools:** Sysmon, CyberChef, Splunk  
**Lessons Learned:**  
- PowerShell logging & Sysmon configuration are critical for IR

## 3. **MiddleMayhem**  
**Scenario:** Multi-stage phishing → credential theft → lateral movement.  
**What I did:**  
- Reconstructed phishing email delivery path  
- Analyzed authentication logs for brute-force & password spraying  
- Identified lateral movement via SMB and RDP  
- Built timeline of attacker actions  
**Findings:**  
- Compromised user account used for internal reconnaissance  
**Tools:** ELK, Sysmon, Zeek  
**Lessons Learned:**  
- MFA enforcement and AD audit policies significantly reduce impact  

---

## 4. **Ozarks**  
**Scenario:** Suspicious outbound traffic from internal host.  
**What I did:**  
- Analyzed PCAP for beaconing patterns  
- Identified DNS tunneling behavior  
- Extracted payloads and enriched IOCs  
**Findings:**  
- Host infected with malware performing C2 over DNS  
**Tools:** Wireshark, Zeek, VirusTotal  
**Lessons Learned:**  
- DNS logging & anomaly detection are essential for SOC visibility  

---

## 5. **Piggy**  
**Scenario:** Unauthorized privilege escalation attempt.  
**What I did:**  
- Investigated Windows Event Logs for privilege abuse  
- Identified exploitation of vulnerable service configuration  
- Mapped attacker actions to MITRE (T1068, T1059)  
**Findings:**  
- Local privilege escalation succeeded due to misconfigured permissions  
**Tools:** Sysmon, Event Viewer, Splunk  
**Lessons Learned:**  
- Least privilege & service hardening prevent escalation attacks
